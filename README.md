# Node.js Server Not Responding to Requests

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js where a server starts without errors but fails to respond to incoming requests.  The bug is present in `server.js`, and a solution is provided in `serverSolution.js`.

## Bug Description

A simple HTTP server is created using the `http` module. The server should respond with 'Hello World!' to any request. However, the server does not respond to requests, leading to issues in client-side applications attempting to communicate with it.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `node server.js`.
3. Attempt to make a request to `http://localhost:3000/` using a tool like `curl` or a web browser.  You will find that the server does not respond.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully examining the request handling logic within the server.  The solution is provided in `serverSolution.js`.  Common issues involve incorrect headers, improper use of the `res.end()` method, or blocking operations within the request handler.
